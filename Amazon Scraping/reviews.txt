Review Title: Brilliant! obvious must read for fans of the series!
Review Text:-
Jk Rowling & the playwright have done a fabulous job.point to note is that it is a script of a play and not a full fledged book. Although one can't help but yearn for the magic of Rowling's detailed writing.

1) The Delivery:The quality is great! Mine arrived just a day after ordering! Looks so PRECIOUS!Must for diehard PotterHeads to own.2)The Story/BookThe story in itself is disappointing, though. Lots of parts have loopholes and don't make sense. Barely upto the HP standards that we're familiar with. But thats not Amazon's fault, is it?

It Was Really Nostalgic Reading This Book.. Not As Good As The 1st Seven Books But Definitely Worth The Buy For True HP Fans.

As a die-hard fan, I must confess that I was a little disappointed. The 'eighth story' doesn't really fit into the world of the seven that are known to us. It misses the depth and the brilliance of the other stories. Being in the format of a play restricts it to a great extent.Nevertheless, I know that none of the fans will be able to resist it. So, go ahead and read. :)

Review Title: The seller may cheat youüôÅ
Review Text:-
The story was perfect with lots of twists and turns but the book I received Did not make me put five stars as the review because I payed for the hardcover book and I got the paperback one.... I have tried ordering it 3 times and all the times I have been disappointed by the service. It was disheartening to receive this book as it has poor quality.. I feel betrayed and cheated by the sellers

Review Title: What were they thinking?
Review Text:-
As a Harry Potter fan, I do not know how this book was allowed to be marketed. This book is a collection of the stupidest fan fictions written over the last 15 years. It plays fast and loose with the concepts and logic that were developed painstakingly over 7 books. NOT recommended unless you are fond of silly, soppy romance stories.

Review Title: Disappointing
Review Text:-
The book is disappointing.Its in the format of a play ( which was clearly mentioned in the description).Being a play we lose out on the best part of the harry potter series- the descriptive details about events, the characters thoughts.Furthermore the play seems to be full of twists and turns in order to make it interesting. Rowling should have left it at 7 books.
